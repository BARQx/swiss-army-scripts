# 🛠️ Swiss Army Scripts

A collection of handy scripts — some hand-crafted, some AI-assisted.  
Think of this as a Swiss Army knife still under construction — right now, it’s more like a screwdriver or a can opener.

## 📂 Current Scripts

### 🧠 Keyman / XKB
- `kmn_to_xkb.py` – Converts Keyman `.kmn` keyboard layouts to XKB `symbols` format.
- `evdev_generator.py` – Generates `evdev.xml` entries from Keyman layout metadata.

_This collection may grow over time as I build more utilities._
