# 🛠️ Swiss Army Scripts

A collection of handy scripts — some hand-crafted, some AI-assisted.
Think of this as a Swiss Army knife still under construction — right now, it’s more like a screwdriver or a can opener.

_This collection may grow over time as I build more utilities._

## 📂 Usage

Each script includes its usage instructions directly at the top of the file, in a comment block.
Open any `.py` file to see how to run it, what inputs it expects, and what it does.

Example:
```python
